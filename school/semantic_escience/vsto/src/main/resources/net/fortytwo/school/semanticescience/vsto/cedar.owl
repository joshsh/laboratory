    >Adelaide Australia MF Radar</vsto:hasDescription>
    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >The Adelaide, Australia (34.56S, 138.48E; ~19 m alt) 1.98 MHz MF radar has been in operation since 1983 at the location of Buckingham Park, just outside of Adelaide. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (28.2,-149.8) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 48.0 deg and -6.4 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 0856 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT plus 9 hours and 14 minutes (138.48/15.=9.232). Code 42 (LST-UT) was corrected from 1.E-03 hr to hhmm in Sep 2004.

The original data files are hourly averages of the zonal and meridional velocity in Australian Central Standard Time (ACST), which is 9 hr 30 min later than UT. Samples are taken every 2 min, so a possible 30 samples can be had between ACST 9:00:00 and ACST 9:59:00, which is labelled as hour 9:00:00 ACST. The midpoint is 9:30:00 ACST or 0:00:00 UT, or 9:14:00 SLT. Local times have been converted to the mid-point SLT, or 14 min (0.232 hr) are added to the begin LT.

The MF operating frequency is 1.98 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 25 kW, 50 kW starting in 1995. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 and 25 millisec, respectively during the day and night. There are usually 32 coherent integrations during the day and 16 at night, using 256 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, want about 2 min or 102.4 sec integration day or night, or 12.5x10-3sec * 32 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec and 25x10-3sec * 16 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec.]

The height coverage is 50-98 km during the day and 70-98 km during the night, at Adelaide. The pulse width is 30 microsec, giving a height resolution of 4.5 km assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse [range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 30x10-6s / 2 = 4.5 km]. However, the height range provided is every 2 km between 60 and 98 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Tromso MF radar is located in Norway (70 N, 19 E). The mean solar local time (SLT) is Universal Time (UT) plus 1 hour and 18 minutes. (SLT = UT + 1:18). The phases are in SLT and the measurement days start at 0 UT. The Tromso MF radar data is obtained and analyzed by the Saskatoon MF radar scientists, and has provided considerable mean winds (Manson et al., 1990a and 1991a) and tidal data (Manson et al, 1989). LTCS-1 and LTCS-2 are described for all middle atmosphere radars in Manson et al. (1990b, 1991b). MF radars use the spaced antenna method. Harmonic analysis is applied to hourly mean winds (weighted by data yield per hour) at individual heights to obtain tides for the prime LTCS or stated intervals. Typical standard deviations for means, 12-hour and 24-hour tides are in the above LTCS papers. Tides of the month for Tromso are means of 4-day fits (the amplitudes are arithmetic means). Data up to 99 km are real heights --- above, they are from the E-region, a layer about 5 km centered near 102 km.</rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at St. Santin, France (44.6N, 2.2E) operated between 1963 and 1987. The CEDAR Data Base holds all the data taken from 1966 until the end. Up until June 1973 and after July of 1986, the only receiver station operating was located at Nancay (47.4N, 2.2E). Between 1973 and 1986, 2 other receivers also operated at Montpazier (44.7N, 0.8E) and at Mende (44.5N, 3.45E).

In general, the daytime height range is 105 to 350 km, while the nighttime height range is 200 to 500 km. Before January 1, 1969, the faraday correction is not taken into account in the computation. The spectrum are analysed following the scheme described in Waldteufel (1970). The ion drift component is quasi parallel to the magnetic field as measured by the Nancay receiving station. Because the transmitter is not located at the receiving location, the bisector velocity is plotted for the period when only Nancay data were received. When all 3 receivers were on, then the data are 30 minute averages and the ion drifts in the geomagnetic coordinate system are calculated.

There are 4 areas in the summary plots. There are image plots as a function of height and time of the electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature. Bin sizes are 40 minutes in time and 40 km in height. For the Nancay period alone there is also an image plot of the bisector velocity, while this is replaced by line plots of the ion drift in the perpendicular east, north and parallel directions at the altitude closest to 300 km. when there are 3 receivers.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Utah State University (USU) Rayleigh lidar at the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO) is run by the Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences (CASS). It is located at Logan, Utah at (41.74N, 111.81W) on the roof of the Science and Engineering Research (SER) building on campus. The height is 1466 m using the WGS84 geoid to represent the earth. The lidar is operated in the vertical direction and can obtain data on all non-heavy cloud nights. (Thin cirrus clouds are OK.) An operator is present to operate the system and for aircraft safety. The lidar started operations in August 1993, with relatively regular operations up to the present except between April 1997 and May 1998 when the lidar was not operating.

The lidar operates at a wavelength of 532 nm up to about 500 km, but collects meaningful data only between about 45 and 100 km. The height resolution of the data is originally 37.5 m using 3600 shots (30 per sec) over 2 minutes. However, averaging is done over 81 range gates (81*37.5m = 3.0375 km) with a sliding average reported every 112.5 m (3 range gates). The number of 2-min integrations is reported as Code 415. Hourly averages of 29 or less 2 minute intervals are calculated, where cloudy or otherwise unusable periods have been eliminated in the hourly average (kindat=17002). Nightly average profiles are also computed.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) has launched DMSP satellites since the mid 1970s. All the satellites have had precipitating particle spectrometer sensors (SSJ2-J4) on board. The SSJ4 sensor was first flown on DMSP-F6 in late 1982, so 1983 is the start of the automatically computed equivalent boundary data set. The official name of the index is "The Air Force Research Laboratory Auroral Boundary Index" and should be acknowledged as being provided by the USAF Research Laboratory, Hanscom AFB, MA. A courtesy copy of any publications using the index should also be sent to Dr. M. Susan Gussenhoven-Shea or her replacement, Dr. Katharine Kadinsky-Cade, at Air Force Research Laboratory, VSBXS, 29 Randolph Road, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA 01731-3010.

For most of the DMSP orbits on a given day, the auroral oval is crossed twice in each hemisphere, once on the ascending leg, and once on the descending leg. The auroral oval expands during increased auroral or magnetic activity and the equtorward boundary is strongly related to Kp (Gussenhoven et al., 1981). The poleward boundary is more difficult to detect than the equatorward boundary, so only the equatorward boundary is found automatically. Hand selection of the equatorward boundary is described in Gussenhoven et al. [1981, 1983]. The magnetic latitude of the equatorward boundary of the aurora is found for a particular orbit at a particular MLT. Then the magnetic latitude of the equivalent equatorward boundary at midnight magnetic local time (0 MLT) can be estimated by statistically determining the position of the auroral oval for every local time sector as a function of some magnetic activity index, such as Kp.

A computer algorithm was written to select the boundaries imitating the rules for hand selection with a quality flag of: 'best', 'good', 'not good'. Only those flagged as 'best' are released. Determination of the quality depends on a variety of factors. Generally,the clearest boundaries occur premidnight, that is, on the evening side, but not prior to 17 MLT. The next best are on the dawn side. Here, however, the flux levels are decreasing and the boundaries are not sharp. The worst boundaries are on the dayside, and near midnight when the oval is cut obliquely. Therefore, the preponderance of boundaries with the 'best' flag are on the evening side. Only 1/3 of the total are 'best' boundaries.

The equivalent equatorward boundary determined for 0 MLT is always defined positive, regardless of the hemisphere of the satellite. These data are also available as yearly files from the contact persons. The ftp and web sites at AFRL have been disconnected. Publically available plots from 1983 are at /instruments/eqb.html.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Vostok ground magnetometer station is located in Antarctica (-78.463 S, 106.826 E) and has been operated by the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute of St. Petersburg since 1958. The analog data have been digitized for 1978 and 1979, and for 1983-1995. A 1-sec digital magnetometer was installed in 1996. The station is part of the former Soviet Union's scientific exploration of Antarctica, which started in 1957 during the International Geophysical Year (IGY). It is located near the center of the Antarctic ice sheet, about 3488 m above mean sea level, and about 1250 km from McMurdo and about 1500 km from Mirny on the coast.

Vostok is located in the polar cap at a high magnetic latitude. In 1978, the magnetic field at the surface was about 60950 nT, with an inclination angle of -77.682 degrees, a declination angle of -11.835 degrees, and an apex magnetic location of (-83.30, 53.56). In 2001, the magnetic field at the surface was about 59470 nT, with an inclination angle of -76.807 degrees, a declination angle of -12.019 degrees, and an apex magnetic location of (-83.31, 55.11). The apex magetic location of -83.3 is very close to the corrected geomagnetic (cgm) location of -83.4 cgmlat used for Vostok. </rdfs:comment>

            >These are monthly climatology neutral tidal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere for data taken between 1978 and 1982 by the meteor wind radar at Durham, New Hampshire.

The meteor wind radar at Durham, New Hampshire (43.12 Deg.N, 70.94 Deg.W) has operated routinely during most years since 1974. The radar looks at 45 deg. elevation in the Northeast and Northwest directions with beamwidths of +-20 degrees. The system is a computer controlled coherent pulsed radar at 36.8 Mhz. Measurements are made of the direction cosines, slant range, and slant range doppler. Since a horizontal wind is assumed, only measurements with zenith angles less than 60 degrees are used in the tidal analysis. The height of the meteor trail reflection points have a Gaussian distribution centered at approximately 95 km with a standard deviation of approximately 9 km.

Significant results are achieved by averaging over 4 days. These are the 12 monthly climatologies created by binning 4-day averages over 5 years in the appropriate month. The tidal analysis is based on the method developed by Groves (1959) using 30 coefficients. The results are least mean square fits to the data. The error bars are about 8 m/s at 80 and 107 km, and are about 5 m/s at 95 km. The phases are given only to the nearest hour, which refers to Eastern Standard Time (EST = UT - 5 hrs). The local mean solar time for Durham is the Universal Time minus 4 hours and 44 minutes. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Utah State University (USU) CEDAR Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM) is a mobile CCD imager that has been operated in several mid and low latitude locations since its construction was completed in 1996. The imager was built to investigate mesospheric temperature and wave induced variability using the [OH] emission (mean altitude 87 km). In March of 1996 it was tested at Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) (41.933N, 111.417W, 1981 m) and took data at BLO between 7-18 Oct 1996, 4-15 May 1997, and 4 Aug - 24 Sep, 1998. For a year between 11 June 1997 and 2 June 1998, the MTM took data alongside the Colorado State University Na Temperature lidar at Fort Collins, Colorado (40.590N, 105.140W, 1570 m). It was moved to the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) near Albuquerque, New Mexico (34.9639N, 106.4619W), and took data from October 1998 to Dec 1999 alongside the University of Illinois Wind Temperature lidar and all-sky imager and University of Western Ontario Meteor radar. The MTM was then upgraded at USU to include a capability to measure mesospheric temperature using the [O2] nightglow emission (mean altitude 94 km) as well as the [OH] emission. It was then tested and operated at BLO during the period Oct 2000-June 2001. Most recently it was deployed to Maui, Hawaii (20.75N, 156.24W) to take data from October 2001 until the present. The latter data (KINDAT=17087 for OH and KINDAT=17094 for O2) are currently available as nightly mean determinations of [OH] and [O2] rotational temperatures centered at 87 and 94 km, respectively. These data also provide relative band intensities. Higher temporal resolution data are available on request to USU. They start in 2002 to coincide with the TIMED satellite instrumentation deployment.

The USU MTM is a CCD imager that measures the hydroxyl [OH] Meinel nightglow in the (6,2) rotational band and the o2 (0,1) molecular oxygen band, both emissions occurring in the near infrared (NIR). The [OH] rotational temperature is derived from the intensity ratio of the P1(4)/P1(2) lines within the (6,2) rotational band. The rotational temperature should be close to the atmospheric temperature under normal equilibrium conditions. The [OH] emission layer is centered near 87 km (+/-2 km) with a thickness of about 8 km. The O2 emission originates at somewhat higher mean altitude of 94 km but has a similar effective layer thickness (FWHM) of about 8 km. Together these measurements permit the investigation of mesospheric temperature variability at two closely spaced but separate regions important for wave-induced (gravity wave, tides and planetary wave) as well as seasonal and longer term variations. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Halley HF radar is located in Antarctica (76 degs S, 26 deg W) and overlooks a section of ionosphere poleward of 78 deg that covers much of eastern Antarctica and includes South Pole station. The field -of-view is conjugate to the west coast of Greenland and the Goose Bay HF radar. It has operated since 1988. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from western North America to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of Halley velocity data is located at Syowa, Antarctica.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. A second 4-element array provide the capability to measure elevation angle. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15) ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz) iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70) iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is typically 6 or 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is 96 sec or 120 sec. Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 165 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Arecibo Observatory Fabry-Perot interferometer (18.35N, 66.75W) has been in operation since 1972. The data reported here (1980-1988), are atomic oxygen measurements at 630.0 nm. According to the IGRF model, the magnetic declination angle at Arecibo varied between -9.4 and -10.4 degrees between February 1980 and July 1988, while the inclination angle varied between 48.8 and 47.9 degrees. All nights are clear, or had cloudy periods removed. The approximate emission height is assumed to be 300 km. Scans in azimuth were done at a 30 degree elevation height, with usually one zenith measurment per scan.

The intensities are relative, (Code 2505) but are approximately correct to within a factor of two of the true emission intensities in Rayleighs. The Doppler half-width is related to the square root of the neutral temperature assuming a Gaussian emission shape. The instrument was not optimized to measure Doppler widths, but was broadened to increase the signal throughput in order to make better measurements of the Doppler shift, which is related to the neutral velocity. Because of uncertainties in the half-width, the conversion to temperature was not made.

In some of the data files the zenith observations were used as a zero reference in the analysis (Code 4050=1), while for others, all of the measurements for a given night were used (Code 4050=0) by assuming that each component of the horizontal neutral wind velocity can be represented by a second order Taylor expansion (constant horizontal velocity gradients) about a point directly above the station. A harmonic analysis gives the zonal (Ue) and meridional (Un) velocities, and two parameters related to the deformation of the flow, d(Ue)/dx and d(Un)/dy, where x and y are the eastward and northward directions, respectively. The vertical wind velocity (Uz) is thus not measured directly, but is derived from the DC term of the expansion. Values of Uz are inferred as the product of the horizontal divergence of the horizontal wind velocity, Uh, and the neutral scale height H: i.e., Uz = H del(Uh) where H = 50 km.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Fabry-Perot Spectrometer at Arrival Heights, Antarctica (77.8296 S, 166.6627 E, 190.3 m ASL) has been operated since 2002 by the Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington. The apex magnetic coordinates of Arrival Heights at 250 km height in 2002 were (-80.1, -34.3) with a magnetic declination of 142.6 deg, an inclination of -81.3 deg, and 0 UT at 17.15 MLT.

The dispersing element of the spectrometer is an air-spaced, 14 cm diameter effective clear-aperture Fabry-Perot etalon, which is both self-aligning and self-stabilizing. It is operated near the optimum operational point (2.0 cm spacer) for kinetic temperature determinations (Hernandez, 1988).

The spectrometer operates simultaneously at two wavelengths, which are arbitrarily selected by the use of dichroic mirrors and narrow (0.3 nm wide) interference filters. The inherent stability of the spectrometer is about 0.5 m/s (632.8 nm) for periods of months, because of its self-stabilizing properties. The instrumental internal stability calibration is updated every 9 s.</rdfs:comment>

            >The ST (strato/troposphere) radar at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) at Arecibo, Puerto Rico (18.3N, 66.75W), made measurements during the AIDA (Arecibo Initiative in Dynamics of the Atmosphere) campaign of March-May, 1989, an international multi-instrument campaign which was conducted to compare wind measurements in the mesosphere taken by various radar and optical devices. The tropo- and stratosphere data taken by the Arecibo ST radar during this period were largely decoupled from the main objectives and the observations of the other instruments. Data are available for both day and night times. Integration time per profile varies and is on the order of 30 sec to 1 min. However, because the mesosphere observations were interleaved with this data set, there are many gaps between profiles on the order of a few minutes. During AIDA, the altitude range sampled was from about 5 to 20 km, and the resolution was about 0.3 km. For this data set, the antenna azimuth scan pattern was very roughly as follows: 1.5 hrs at 14 or 32 deg, 10 min at -76 or -58 deg, 10 min at 194 or 212 deg, 30 min at 104 or 122 deg, 10 min at 194 or 212 deg, and 10 min at -76 or -58 deg, then repeat. Beware that the times do appear to vary. Elevation angle was fixed at about 79 degrees. Results from AIDA have been published in J. Atmos. Terr. Phys., 55, 1993, a special issue dedicated to the campaign. H. Mario Ierkic was responsible for the operation of the Arecibo ST radar during AIDA, and John Cho put this data set into the CEDAR Data Base.

This program extracts the following data from the Doppler spectra of the Arecibo ST radar: (1) Line-of-sight velocity of the clear air, (2) signal spectral width, and (3) SNR. Item (1) is self-explanatory. Items (2) and (3) yield information about the actual radar scattering mechanism. If the mechanism is turbulence, then (1) and (3) yield the turbulence intensity.

            >The total hemispheric power input is computed from NOAA/TIROS and DMSP satellite measurements of high latitude precipitating energy flux carried by ions and electons with energies between 300 eV and 20 keV (NOAA/TIROS), or carried by electrons with energies between 460 eV and 30 keV (DMSP). The satellite orbits are sun synchronous around 850 km altitude. Times given are the center of the polar pass used to make the estimate where a typical polar pass takes about 25 minutes. Often there are two satellites operating simultaneously providing coverage at 30 to 60 minute intervals between auroral latitude crossings. The energy flux observations made during a single pass over the polar regions (above about 45 degrees of magnetic latitude) are used to estimate the total precipitating power input to a single hemisphere at that time. This power index was devised by David Evans for the NOAA/TIROS satellites, and adapted for the DMSP satellites by Frederick Rich and William Denig.</rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at St. Santin, France (44.6N, 2.2E) operated between 1963 and 1987. The CEDAR Data Base holds all the data taken from 1966 until the end. Up until June 1973 and after July of 1986, the only receiver station operating was located at Nancay (47.4N, 2.2E). Between 1973 and 1986, 2 other receivers also operated at Montpazier (44.7N, 0.8E) and at Mende (44.5N, 3.45E).

In general, the daytime height range is 105 to 350 km, while the nighttime height range is 200 to 500 km. Before January 1, 1969, the faraday correction is not taken into account in the computation. The spectrum are analysed following the scheme described in Waldteufel (1970). The ion drift component is quasi parallel to the magnetic field as measured by the Nancay receiving station. Because the transmitter is not located at the receiving location, the bisector velocity is plotted for the period when only Nancay data were received. When all 3 receivers were on, then the data are 30 minute averages and the ion drifts in the geomagnetic coordinate system are calculated.

There are 4 areas in the summary plots. There are image plots as a function of height and time of the electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature. Bin sizes are 40 minutes in time and 40 km in height. For the Nancay period alone there is also an image plot of the bisector velocity, while this is replaced by line plots of the ion drift in the perpendicular east, north and parallel directions at the altitude closest to 300 km. when there are 3 receivers.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Digisonde (DGS-256) located at Qaanaaq, Greenland (77.5N, 290.6E) and operated by the University of Massachusettes Lowell Center for Atmospheric Research, for Phillips Laboratory Hanscom AFB, has produced ion velocity measurements and electron density profiles since 1983. The data are originally collected in local magnetic coordinates, and then converted to geographic coordinates using the declination angle of -71.0 for an altitude of 0 km.

The Digisonde generally operates in a 15 minute cycle mode, where the first 2-3 minutes an ionogram is recorded followed generally by 1-2 minutes of drift measurements, with the remaining 10-12 minutes idle. Sometimes the cycle time is 5 minutes. The range of altitudes is about 200-450 km, where the mean is about 300 km.

Digisondes transmit HF radio waves illuminating a large ionospheric area of several hundred kilomaters diameter over the sounder. Radio waves are sent up and reflected off orthogonal surfaces. Each reflection point is considered to be a separate source and has associated with it a line- of-sight (los) Doppler velocity measurement. Making the assumption that the main contribution to the measured Doppler shifts results from the uniform horizontal bulk motion of the plasma, the los velocity and source location are used to calculate the velocity vector by least squares fit.

The drift mode operated at Qaanaaq during 1989 resulted in up to a maximum of 64 sources in a single integration period of 5 seconds. One minute data is obtained where the error bar is the average of the standard deviations from 12 5-second integrations, while the value of each velocity component is the median from a further velocity distribution found using all the data points in the entire one minute period. The 1 minute results were taken and reported every 15 minutes. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Davis, Antarctica (68.60S, 77.97E; ~1 m alt) 1.94 MHz MF radar has been in operation since April 1994. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (64.1, 152.4) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 81.7 deg and 21.7 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 0505 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT plus 5 hours and 12 minutes (77.97/15.=5.198). Code 42 (LST-UT) was corrected from 1.E-03 hr to hhmm in Sep 2004.

The original data files are hourly averages of the zonal and meridional velocity in Local Time (LT), which is 5 hours later than UT. Smaples are taken every 2 min, so a possible 30 samples can be had between 05:00:00 LT and 06:00:00 LT. The midpoint is 05:30:00 LT or 0:30:00 UT, or 5:42:00 SLT. Local times have been converted to the mid-point SLT, or 42 min (0.618 hr) are added to the beginning LT hour.

The MF operating frequency is 1.94 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 25 kW, 40 kW starting in 2004. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 and 25 millisec, respectively during the day and night. There are usually 32 coherent integrations during the day and 16 at night, using 256 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, want about 2 min or 102.4 sec integration day or night, or 12.5x10-3sec * 32 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec and 25x10-3sec * 16 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec.]

The height coverage is 50-100 km during the day or night at Davis. The pulse width is 30 microsec, giving a height resolution of 4.5 km assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse [range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 30x10-6s / 2 = 4.5 km]. However, the height range provided is every 2 km between 50 and 100 km starting in 2003, and 50 and 98 km earlier. </rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at St. Santin, France (44.6N, 2.2E) operated between 1963 and 1987. The CEDAR Data Base holds all the data taken from 1966 until the end. Up until June 1973 and after July of 1986, the only receiver station operating was located at Nancay (47.4N, 2.2E). Between 1973 and 1986, 2 other receivers also operated at Montpazier (44.7N, 0.8E) and at Mende (44.5N, 3.45E).

In general, the daytime height range is 105 to 350 km, while the nighttime height range is 200 to 500 km. Before January 1, 1969, the faraday correction is not taken into account in the computation. The spectrum are analysed following the scheme described in Waldteufel (1970). The ion drift component is quasi parallel to the magnetic field as measured by the Nancay receiving station. Because the transmitter is not located at the receiving location, the bisector velocity is plotted for the period when only Nancay data were received. When all 3 receivers were on, then the data are 30 minute averages and the ion drifts in the geomagnetic coordinate system are calculated.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Kerguelen Island HF radar is located in the southern Indian Ocean (49.35 deg S, 70.28 deg E; 58.9 mag S) and looks poleward. It has operated since 2000. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from Alaska to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of SANAE velocity data is located at Syowa-East station.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. It has no second array for deriving elevation angle information. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15) ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz) iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70) iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is usually 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is then 120 sec (2 min). Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 107.0 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Christmas Island ST (MEDAC) radar is located at (1.95N, 157.30W). The MEDAC (Meteor Echo Detection And Collection) sytem added to the ST (STratospheric) radar makes observations of winds measured from the backscatter off meteor trails. The system is described in Avery et al. (1990). The observations are described in solar local time, which is defined to be 10 hours and 32 minutes after UT (-158/15 = -10.53 or 10 hours and 32 minutes, where the longitude used was 158 W instead of 157.30 W). These are monthly means corresponding to the day numbers given. The days are counted from Hawaiian Standard Time (= UT-10h). Hence, data starting on the first of the month actually starts at 10 UT on the first of the month, and data ending at the end of the month ends on the first day of the next month at 0959 UT. This data set is two years of data from September 1988 to August 1989, and for all of 1991. The analysis will be revised in the future.</rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter radar at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) at Arecibo, Puerto Rico (18.3N, 66.75W), has made ionospheric measurements since 1963. The radar facilities are shared with radio astronomers.

The most recent analysis solves between 3 (Ne, Ti, Ti) and 5 parameters (Ne, Ti, Te, H+/Ne, He+/Ne) simultaneously. The line-of-sight velocity is found in a separate fit to the slope of the auto-correlation function (ACF). There are several corrections that are applied to the data. These include a chirp correction for the velocities, eliminating bad data records due to satellites or ground based radio communication (some outliers remain), and calibration of electron densities with ionosonde data in post processing.

In the lower altitudes, a molecular ion model is assumed. The model was determined by looking for consistency in the other parameters. The molecular ion mass is assumed to be 30 amu and the assumed molecular ion composition is:

            >The all-sky scanning imaging Fabry-Perot Spectrometer (ASIFPS) at Poker Flat, Alaska (65.12N, 147.43W) is also known as a Scanning Doppler Instrument (SDI). It is an extremely high resolution optical imaging spectrometer. It measures the angular distribution of Doppler shifts and of Doppler broadening of optical airglow and auroral light emitted from the Earth's upper atmosphere, across the entire sky scene that is visible to the gorund-based instrument, down to a zenith angle of ~75 deg. The distributions of Doppler shifts and of Doppler broadening across the sky are used to infer geographic maps of the wind and temperature distributions prevailing within the emission layer.

The instrument is located on a ridge-top, 50 km ENE from Fairbanks and at 440 m above mean sea level. It has been operated since November 1994 by the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska as part of the optical diagnostic instruments at the Poker Flat Research Range. The building is aligned in the magnetic north direction at 28.5 degrees azimuth to NE. The apex magnetic coordinates of Poker Flat in December 2001 at 240 km were (65.25, -95.41), with a magnetic declination of 23.56 deg to NE, an inclination of 77.36 deg to SW, and 0 UT at 1231 MLT. At 96 km, apex coordinates are (65.23, -95.45), with a magnetic declination of 24.28 deg, an inclination of 77.37 deg, and 0 UT at 1231 MLT. The observations are reported in approximate local magnetic coordinates, rotated 28.5 degrees clockwise from geographic, and also in geographic coordinates. The magnetic skew angle (code 1020) is about 4.6 deg, which is negligible.

The instrument is based on a 100-mm aperture capacitance-stabilized Fabry-Perot etalon, the plates of which are piezoelectrically scannable in spacing over approximately 1.5 orders of interference (at 630-nm) about a nominal 20-mm gap. Skylight is coupled into the etalon through an all-sky lens and optical relay system which maps an approximately 75-degree half-angle field-of-view onto 6 orders of interference at the etalon. Interference fringes formed by the etalon are conjugate with the sky. The sky, modulated by this fringe pattern, is re-imaged onto an intensified CCD detector, after first passing through a narrow-band interference filter. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Digisonde (DISS) located at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland (67.0N,309.05E) and operated by the University of Massachusettes Lowell Center for Atmospheric Research, for Air Force Research Laboratory Hanscom AFB, has produced ion velocity measurements and electron density profiles since 1986. The data are originally collected in local magnetic coordinates, and then converted to geographic coordinates using the declination angle of -41.2 for an altitude of 0 km.

The Digisonde generally operates in a 15 minute cycle mode, where the first 2-3 minutes an ionogram is recorded followed generally by 1-2 minutes of drift measurements, with the remaining 10-12 minutes idle. Sometimes the cycle time is 5 minutes. The range of altitudes is about 200-450 km, where the mean for the 1993 data was set to 250 km.

Digisondes transmit HF radio waves illuminating a large ionospheric area of several hundred kilomaters diameter over the sounder. Radio waves are sent up and reflected off orthogonal surfaces. Each reflection point is considered to be a separate source and has associated with it a line- of-sight (los) Doppler velocity measurement. Making the assumption that the main contribution to the measured Doppler shifts results from the uniform horizontal bulk motion of the plasma, the los velocity and source location are used to calculate the velocity vector by least squares fit.

The drift mode resulted in up to a maximum of 64 sources in a single integration period of 5 seconds. One minute data is obtained where the error bar is the average of the standard deviations from 12 5-second integrations, while the value of each velocity component is the median from a further velocity distribution found using all the data points in the entire one minute period. The 1 minute results were taken and reported every 15 minutes. </rdfs:comment>

            >The SANAE (South African National Antarctic Expedition) HF radar is located in Antarctica (71.68 deg S, -2.85 deg E) and looks over a section of ionosphere poleward of 65 deg S that covers much of East Antarctica. It has operated since 1997. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from Alaska to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of SANAE velocity data is located at Halley Station.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. It has no second array for deriving elevation angle information. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15) ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz) iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70) iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is usually 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is then 120 sec (2 min). Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 107.0 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Incoherent Scatter routine measurement with the MU (Middle and Upper atmosphere) radar (34.8N, 136.1E) uses 4 beam directions simultaneously, with the first 15 minutes of each hour devoted to single-pulse measurements (for electron density), and the last 45 minutes devoted to two-pulse (for ion drift velocity) or four-pulse (for ion/electron temperature) measurements. The radar operates at a frequency of 46.5 MHz and uses a beam width of 3.7 degrees. Measurements have been taken about 2 days per month starting on September 17, 1986.

The 4 beams are at an elevation angle of 70 degrees pointing towards magnetic north, east, south and west, assuming a declination angle of -5 degrees. The inclination angle is about 48 degrees, and the corrected magneitc latitude of the MU radar is about 25 degrees.

The initial range resolution of the velocities is 38 km. Velocities are averaged between 220 and 455 km, where the altitude of the measurement is defined to be 338, the midpoint of the 235 km range. A running 3-hour average of the ACF is computed as well as the height average before the line of sight (los) ion drift velocity is computed, so there are no error bars. The UT time is the midpoint of the 45 minutes of the middle hour. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Fabry-Perot Interferometer at Resolute Bay, Canada (74.73N, -94.89E, 87 m ASL) has been operated since 2003 by the High Altitude Observatory of the National Center For Atmospheric Research. The apex magnetic coordinates of Resolute Bay at 250 km height in 2004 were (83.1, -39.0) with a magnetic declination of -24.4 deg, an inclination of 88.0 deg, and 0 UT at 16.31 MLT.

The dispersing element of the interferometer is an air-spaced, 10 cm diameter effective clear-aperture Fabry-Perot etalon. It has a fixed gap of 2.0 cm. The etalon is housed in a temperature controlled chamber (Wu et al. 2004). The instrument detector is a back illuminated CCD camera with 1024x1024 pixels and 1x1 inch size. The CCD temperature is set at -55 C. The readout noise of the CCD is 4 electrons.

The interferometer has an 8-position filter wheel. The wavelengths used at Resolute Bay are:

   1. The red line (630.0 nm, kindat=17001) of atomic oxygen (OI) with a typical emission height peak in the range 210 to 300 km.
   2. The green line (557.7 nm, kindat=17002) of atomic oxygen (OI), with a typical emission height peak range near 94-98 km.
   3. The [OH] line (892.0 nm, kindat=17003) of the nightglow excited hydroxyl [OH*] with an emission peak between about 87 and 91 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Platteville, CO ST (MEDAC) radar is located at (40 N, 105 W). The MEDAC (Meteor Echo Detection And Collection) sytem added to the ST (STratospheric) radar makes observations of winds measured from the backscatter off meteor trails. The system is described in Avery et al. (1990). The original observations are described in local time, which is 7 hours later than UT. (Mountain Standard Time = UT - 7 hours.) The mean solar local time (SLT) is about 7 hours after UT. (i.e., -105 E/15 deg/hr = -7.00 hours). Therefore, no adjustment was made to the phase, since the local time is very close to the solar local time.

These are the analyzed data on the neutral winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere during or including the LTCS-2 period, 5-10 December 1988. This condensed format is consistent with the analyzed data from other sites as well, and is prepared in order to facilitate research work. However, users need to inform the data suppliers that they are using the data in case of updates or changes, and to insure that the data are being used and interpreted properly.</rdfs:comment>

            >The College, Alaska Fabry-Perot interferometer was located on the roof of the Geophysical Institute in the years reported here (1981-1983). This is at 64.7N and 148.1W in geographic coordinates, where the corrected geomagnetic coordinates are 64.9N and 100.3W. This is relatively close to the Chatanika incoherent scatter radar site at 65.1N and 147.4W, which operated between 1971 and 1982. The IGRF model gives a magnetic declination angle of about 25 degrees and inclination angle of 76 degrees for the measurement period. However, the measurements were made relative to the magnetic field direction where the declination was assumed to be 30 degrees. This is not significantly different from the true declination, so the derived horizontal results are reported as being in the magnetic directions. The measurements are all at 630.0 nm. All nights included are clear, or had cloudy periods removed.

The zenith measurements are assumed to be on average zero throughout the night. All other measurements were taken in directions relative to the magnetic E, N, W and S directions at elevations angles between 20 and 45 degrees, and were converted to horizontal directions assuming an emission layer centered at 225 km.

The intensities are relative, (Code 2505) but are approximately within 25% of the true intensities in Rayleighs.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Collm Geophysical Observatory (51.31 N 13.003 E) uses the closely spaced receiver method at 177, 225, and 270 kHz. Two receivers are used to the geographic north and east of the radar so the center of the reflection point triangle is near (52 N, 15 E). The measurements of the nighttime neutral winds and virtual heights are averaged over half-hour intervals from measurements of about 3/minute for winds and about 300/minute for virtual heights.

The virtual height of the half-hour means is converted to true height using an empirical relation with linear height reduction (Kurschner et al, 1987). Then the half-hour means of the zonal and meridional winds are put through a multiple regression analysis to determine the altitude dependance of the prevailing and semi-diurnal tidal winds. To improve the spectral sensitivity, it proved useful to assume a circularly polarized tidal wind, which is acceptable for mid-latitudes. Therefor, the amplitude of the zonal and meridional semi-diurnal tidal wind is equal, and the phase of the meridional wind is 3 hours earlier than that of the zonal wind. Similarly, the amplitude of the zonal and meridional diurnal tidal wind is equal, and the phase of the meridional wind is 6 hours earlier than that of the zonal wind. However, the 24 hour component is normally only computed for the height of 95 km where the signal is a maximum. The result should be treated with some caution considering the fact that the observations are nighttime only.

The phases are in mean local solar time (SLT). There is 1 hour between SLT and UT since the measurements are near 15E. Most of the calculations are for the period of a month. Extra information of interest such as seasonal transitions and the quasi two-day wave are in catalogue records. The data in the CEDAR Data Base are from January 1993 to January 1997, with selected Lower Thermosphere Coupling Study (LTCS) periods earlier. </rdfs:comment>

The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from western North America to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of Syowa velocity data is located at SANAE (South African National Antarctic Expedition), Antarctica.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. A second 4-element array provide the capability to measure elevation angle. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15) ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz) iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70) iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is typically 6 or 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is 96 sec or 120 sec. Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 159 deg E of N, or about 52 degrees west of the general scan position of Syowa East. </rdfs:comment>

            >A near infrared (NIR) BOMEM MB160 Michelson interferometer (MI) has operated at Eureka (80.22 N, 86.18 W), Canada, at 139 m above mean sea level since October, 1992.

The MI scans the dark sky NIR airglow emissions between ~5000-10000 cm-1. A periscope directs the airglow into the MI sequentially from four locations: overhead, and at an elevation angle of 25 deg at azimuth angles of 0 (geog N), 120, and 240 deg. The periscope dwells at each of the positions for about 8 min, averaging several scans. Airglow hydroxyl Meinel (OH-M) band emissions peak at 87 km and are located between about 83 and 89 km. For an elevation angle of 25 deg, the 87 km peak is located at a latitude spacing of 1.61 degrees, or about 179 km away. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Peach Mountain (also known as Stinchfield Woods) Fabry-Perot interferometer, operated by the Space Physics Research Laboratory, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences of the University of Michigan is located at latitude 42.40N and longitude 86.93W, and at an altitude of 955 ft.

Currently, the interferometer observes the line profile of the forbidden emission OI (5577 A) and OH (8920 A). The geophysical parameters obtained from the data reduction are the gas kinetic temperature of the emitting region from the natural width of the sky profile, the line of sight wind from the Doppler shift of the sky profile, and the surface brightness of the emission line. OI (5577 A) nightglow emission is generally believed to issue from the altitude range 85 to 300 km, with the major contribution originating from a narrow height interval roughly 10 to 15 km broad centered at 97 km. Similarly, the Meinel OH emission also issues from a broad altitudinal range though centered at a lower altitude. Thus, it is difficult to assign a unique altitude to each ground based OI (5577 A) and OH (8920 A) interferometer measurement. If no other information is available, we generally ascribe 97 km as the altitude of OI (5577 A) emission and 86 km for the OH emission.

Line of sight winds derived from the observed shift of the emission line from a zero reference position requires the determination of a zero wind. The reference zero wind is taken to be the average of an entire nights vertical wind data. Generally, the four cardinal directions are also sampled as well as the vertical. There is no exclusion of any data in the CEDAR Data Base, so cloudy night fits are also included. The cloud cover (code 440) measured by the Detroit Metro airport meteorological station is given in octas of the sky covered. Values range from 0 (clear) to 9 (overcast). In the summary plots, wind measurements were not plotted unless the cloud cover was 0-3. Temperatures and relative emission measurements were not plotted unless the cloud cover was 0-6.</rdfs:comment>

            >These are tidal analyses of the mean neutral winds between 78 and 108 km over consecutive periods of 12 days between June 1984 and November 1990 from the MF radar located at Mawson, Antarctica (67.62 S, 62.89 E). The radar employs the "spaced antenna" method. The tidal analysis is a least squares fit at each altitude for the mean, diurnal and semi-diurnal components. The error is the standard deviation. Observations are made relative to mean solar time (SLT), which is about 4 hours and 12 minutes ahead of UT. (69.89 / 15 deg/hr = 4.19 hrs = 4 hrs 12 min). The diurnal and semi-diurnal tidal components are available for this data set, and can be obtained from R. Vincent. They will be submitted to the CEDAR Data Base in the future. Plots of the mean winds are available in Vincent (1993).

The integration time for these data is 12 days, which means that there is an overlap of days at the end of each year, and sometimes also just before the year's end. Echoes on the 12 days were binned into 24 1-hour bins of SLT. If only 15 hours or less of the full 24 hours were filled, then the tidal analysis was not performed. With 16-24 hours available, a least squares fit was made, where the values were weighted by the number of points and variance in each SLT bin. One should be wary of the results of analyses that are based on less than 20 hours of an SLT day.</rdfs:comment>

The provisional AE indices came from http://swdcdb.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/aedir, where one can get recent estimated AE plots also. The older AE came from World Data Center in Boulder where one can get:

    * hourly AE, AL, AU, AO (1 July 1957 - 30 June 1988)
    * 1 min AE, AL, AU, AO (1 Jan 1986 - 30 June 1988). Previous years of 1 min data must be ordered from NGDC, or taken from the CEDAR Database. 

When the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure uses ground magnetometers, it can calculate the AE at usually 5 minute intervals. AE is thus usually available for the list of AMIE campaigns.</rdfs:comment>

We give the semidiurnal amplitude and phase of the eastward neutral wind, the northward neutral wind, the neutral temperature, and the geopotential. The results are independent of solar cycle, so the year is arbitrary. The year 1988 was chosen because this was the year that the model runs were made. The calculations were done for each month of the year (on the 15th day of the month). Some temperature amplitudes are shown as 0 near the pole but with some phase. This is the result of truncation with amplitudes less than 0.005 K.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Davis, Antarctica (68.48S, 77.97E; 25 m alt) Czerny-Turner (CZT) scanning spectrophotometer obtains mesosphere temperatures from ratios of the hydroxyl (OH) (6-2) band during nighttime hours. The spectrophotometer was in campaign operation March to October 1990 and April to August 1994, and has had continuous winter operations since March 1995. (See Greet et al., 1998; French et al., 2000; Burns et al., 2002.)

Hydroxyl (6-2) band rotational temperatures are derived using Langhoff et al. (1986) transition probabilities, which are approximately 2 K higher than the temperatures derived by French et al. (2000) using experimentally derived P1 branch ratios with a slit width of 100 microns. The hydroxyl layer is centered at a mean height of 87+/-4 km with a mean thickness of 8 km. WINDII data showed that the hydroxyl layer often (up to 25% of the the time) has 2 peaks between 83 and 93 km (She and Lowe, 1998). The brightness of this layer usually decreases during the night.

The spectrophotometer has a 6 degree field-of-view (fov) that was aligned 30-degrees above the horizon in a direction +130 E from Davis away from auroral precipitation in 1990 (Greet et al., 1998). An order separating filter was not used in 1990. Starting in 1994, the optical axis was aligned in the zenith, with a resultant area of about 8 km x 8 km at 87 km. In practice the field of view is defined by the diffraction grating. The diffraction grating rotates about the vertical axis as it scans, so that the area of the grating directly viewing the sky decreases with wavelength (when the grating is at vertical the fov is zero). Thus the fov corresponding to the grating vertical axis varies with grating rotation angle and consequently with wavelength. The instrument is aligned towards the SE (+130 E), but rotates about the vertical as the spectrum is sampled, so these observations are considered to be in the vertical. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Sondre Stromfjord Fabry Perot interferometer, operated by the Space Physics Research Laboratory, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences of the University of Michigan is located at latitude 66.99N and longitude 50.95W. The invariant latitude is 74 degrees, the inclination of the magnetic field is 80 degrees and the declination of the field is -39 degrees (39 degrees to the west). Midnight local solar time at the site occurs at 03:24 UT, while midnight magnetic local time is 01:57 UT at the equinoxes. Magnetic midnight varies with season, being 15 minutes earlier at the winter solstice and 15 minutes later at the summer solstice compared to the equinox value.

Currently, the interferometer observes the line profiles of the forbidden emissions OI (557.7nm) and OI (630.0nm). Most of the data in the CEDAR Database are 630.0nm (code 7001), with additional 557.7nm (code 7002) data starting in 2002. The filter wheel was changed in 2002, resulting in brighter relative emissions. </rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts (42.6N, 71.5W) has been in operation since 1960. The facility is part of and operated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ISR data comes from the fixed zenith antenna, the steerable antenna, or both.

The electron densities from the power profile were calibrated with an on-site ionosonde, where recently, this ionosonde has been the University of Massachusetts at Lowell digisonde. Since the Coast Guard uses some of the frequencies needed to properly scan the ionosphere, calibration can sometimes be difficult. The calibrated electron density is then corrected for Te and Ti effects, where Te and Ti come from auto-correlation fits. The calibration and auto-correlation fits now have the same height resolution, although in the past, the auto-correlation fits had lower height resolution.

The ion composition changes from mostly O2+ and NO+ at lower altitudes, to mostly O+, and then to H+ and some He+ at higher altitudes. Above 400 km, the percent H+ is computed along with the major ion O+. At lower altitudes, the ratio of molecular ions to the total number of ions is modeled as specified by the FORTRAN code segment below.

            >The Poker Flat, Alaska (65.126 N, 147.495 W; alt 208 m) 2.43 MHz MF radar has been in operation since 1998. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (65.4, -95.5) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 77.4 deg and 24.1 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 1233 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT minus 9 hours and 50 minutes (-147.495/15.=-9.833).

The original data files are 30 min averages of the zonal, meridional and 'vertical' velocity in UT. The UT time is the midpoint UT, and is also listed as the midpoint SLT. Samples are taken every 3, 4 or 5 min, so 6 to 10 samples can be had between UT 23:45:00 and UT 00:15:00. To improve data quality, 'median screening' is applied inside a 1-h bin. If data points lie outside a threshold standard deviation (code 4152) of usually 1.5 inside a 1-hr bin, they are discarded. So the low qulity (jamped) data are rejected and then the remaining data are averaged over 30-min bins with a threshold of usually 30% (code 4151). The number of points used in each direction are in codes 422, 423 and 424.

The 'vertical' velocities (code 1432, 'contaminated neutral vertical geographic wind (+up)') are from the beam in the vertical direction. The antenna array in a triangle has a different beam width for different azimuth direction, resulting in beam widths about 20-30 deg wide. Hence, the 'vertical' velocity will be contaminated by horizontal wind times the sine of 10 to 15 degrees (.17 to .26). Since the horizontal winds are stronger than the vertical winds, even the sign could be incorrect. The standard deviations of the 'vertical' winds are also larger than the average values.

The MF operating frequency is 1.95550 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 50 kW. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 millisec during the day and 25 millisec during the night. There are 80 coherent integrations during the day and 40 at night, using 240 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, if want 240 sec or 4 min integration during day and night, then 12.5x10-3sec * 80 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec and 25x10-3sec * 40 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec.]

Data sampling is done every 2 km usually between 60-98 km for Yamagawa (60-108 km for Wakkanai, 44-108 km for Poker Flat). The height range of wind velocity data is variable accoding to atmospheric and radio conditions and is usually about 70-90 km at Yamagawa and Wakkanai during the day and 80-90 km at night (60-90 km/70-90 km for Poker Flat for day/night conditions).

The pulse width is 48 microsec (27 microsec before September 1996), giving a height resolution of approx. 7.2 km (4.1 km) assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse. For the 48-microsec case, the range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 48x10-6s / 2 = 7.2 km. However, neutral velocities are given every 2 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Tirunelveli, India (8.67N, 77.82E; 30 m alt) 1.98 MHz MF radar has been in continuous operation since December 1992. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (6.8, 149.8) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 1.4 deg and -2.6 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 0554 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT plus 5 hours and 11 minutes (77.82/15.=5.188).

The original data files are hourly averages of the zonal and meridional velocity in Indian Standard Time (IST), which is 5 hours and 30 minutes later than UT. Samples are taken every 2 min, so a possible 30 samples can be had between IST 0:00:00 and IST 0:59:00, which is labelled as hour 1:00:00 IST. These times have been converted to the mid-point solar local time (or 0:11 SLT or 0.188 SLT for this example).

The MF radar system is identical to the one operating at Christmas island (2E,158W) and designed by Robert Vincent (robert.vincent@adelaide.edu.au) of the University of Adelaide in Australia (Vincent, 1991). The operating frequency is 1.98 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 25 kW. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 millisec during the day and 25 millisec during the night. There are 32 coherent integrations during the day and 16 at night, using 256 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, want about 2 min or 102.4 sec integration during day and night, or 12.5x10-3sec * 32 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec and 25x10-3sec * 16 integ * 256 samples = 102.4 sec.]

The height coverage is 68-98 km during the day and 70-98 km during the night. The pulse width is 30 microsec, giving a height resolution of 4.5 km assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse [range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 30x10-6s / 2 = 4.5 km]. However, neutral velocities are given every 2 km between 80 and 98 km since the ionization is less below 80 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >The 50 MHz incoherent scatter radar at Jicamarca, Peru (11.95 S, 76.87 W; 520 m alt) has been operating since 1963. On day 359 of 2001 at the ground, the apex magnetic lat,lon were (0.58, -5.12) deg. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 1.145 deg and 0.367 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 UT is ~1835 MLT.

There are three basic types of operating modes for the incoherent scatter radar:

   1. Faraday rotation to obtain electron densities (Ne) and electron (Te) and ion temperatures (Ti)
   2. the drift mode
   3. the bistatic coherent radar mode (E-region Ne above Paracas) 

The drift mode, which finds perpendicular east and north (near vertical) ion drifts, has data from 1984 to the present. The analysis scheme to derive the drifts was changed starting in September of 1994 with a resulting increase in the data quality. Hard copies of time series plots of the older ion drifts are available upon request from NCAR.

The bistatic coherent radar experiment involves the 50 MHz transmitter at Jicamarca and a reciever at Paracas (13.85 S, 76.25 W), which is about 200 km south of Jicamarca. E region (~95-110 km) electron density data are available using a 4 microsecond (~0.6 km) pulse length from Mar 2004. This experiment can run concurrently with either the Faraday rotation or the drift mode. </rdfs:comment>

ISR data comes from the fixed zenith antenna, the steerable antenna, or both.

The electron densities from the power profile were calibrated with an on-site ionosonde, where recently, this ionosonde has been the University of Massachusetts at Lowell digisonde. Since the Coast Guard uses some of the frequencies needed to properly scan the ionosphere, calibration can sometimes be difficult. The calibrated electron density is then corrected for Te and Ti effects, where Te and Ti come from auto-correlation fits. The calibration and auto-correlation fits now have the same height resolution, although in the past, the auto-correlation fits had lower height resolution.

The ion composition changes from mostly O2+ and NO+ at lower altitudes, to mostly O+, and then to H+ and some He+ at higher altitudes. Above 400 km, the percent H+ is computed along with the major ion O+. At lower altitudes, the ratio of molecular ions to the total number of ions is modeled as specified by the FORTRAN code segment below.

The MI scans the dark sky NIR airglow emissions between ~5000-10000 cm-1. A periscope directs the airglow into the MI sequentially from three locations at an elevation angle of 25 deg at azimuth angles of 0 (geog N), 120, and 240 deg. The periscope dwells at each position for about 5 min. Airglow hydroxyl Meinel (OH-M) band emissions peak at 87 km and are located between about 83 and 89 km. For an elevation angle of 25 deg, the 87 km peak is at a latitude spacing of 1.61 degrees, or about 179 km away. </rdfs:comment>

The instrument is operated by Utah State University with support from Stockholm University.

The instrument measures the nightglow hydroxyl [OH]. The [OH] emission layer is centered near 87 km with a thickness of about 8 km. The center of the layer can vary between about 86 and 89 km, giving an error bar in the altitude of about +/6 km considering the thickness also. The rotational temperatures reflect the neutral temperatures in this altitude region. The measured parameters are the hydroxyl Meinel band rotational temperature in Kelvin and the hydroxyl Meinel integrated band radiance in kR and in log10(R).</rdfs:comment>

            >The Aerospace 4 channel filter photometer at Fort Yukon, Alaska (66.57N, 214.73E) was developed to estimate the energy flux of auroral electrons, their average energy Eo (usually from 0.1 to 30 keV using a modified Gaussian or Maxwellian shape), and a scale factor fo for the atomic oxygen densities [O] from an MSIS model atmosphere. The [O] densities using the scaling factor fo can be compared to GUVI/TIMED estimates. The technique is only valid for clear night conditions where the solar zenith angle (sza) is greater than 102 deg (code 4102=1), and there is enough auroral emission (427.8 nm brightness, code 2421). Fort Yukon apex magnetic coordinates are (67.3, -94.7) at 110 km in 2001, with 0 UT corresponding to 12:36 MLT. The magnetic inclination and declination angles are 78.7 deg and 25.6 deg. The photometer looks up the magnetic field line with a field of view (fov) of about 1 deg. The data rate can be programmed, but typically each channel is integrated for 1 sec, where the whole cycle including filter moves takes about 8 sec.

The 4 channels correspond to:

   1. N2+ (427.8 nm, blue) first negative group (1NG) 0,1 molecular band
   2. OI (630.0 nm, red) forbidden
   3. OI (844.6 nm, eight) permitted
   4. N2 (871.0 nm or 871.4 nm) first positive group (1PG) 2,1 molecular band </rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at St. Santin, France (44.6N, 2.2E) operated between 1963 and 1987. The CEDAR Data Base holds all the data taken from 1966 until the end. Up until June 1973 and after July of 1986, the only receiver station operating was located at Nancay (47.4N, 2.2E). Between 1973 and 1986, 2 other receivers also operated at Montpazier (44.7N, 0.8E) and at Mende (44.5N, 3.45E).

In general, the daytime height range is 105 to 350 km, while the nighttime height range is 200 to 500 km. Before January 1, 1969, the faraday correction is not taken into account in the computation. The spectrum are analysed following the scheme described in Waldteufel (1970). The ion drift component is quasi parallel to the magnetic field as measured by the Nancay receiving station. Because the transmitter is not located at the receiving location, the bisector velocity is plotted for the period when only Nancay data were received. When all 3 receivers were on, then the data are 30 minute averages and the ion drifts in the geomagnetic coordinate system are calculated.

There are 4 areas in the summary plots. There are image plots as a function of height and time of the electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature. Bin sizes are 40 minutes in time and 40 km in height. For the Nancay period alone there is also an image plot of the bisector velocity, while this is replaced by line plots of the ion drift in the perpendicular east, north and parallel directions at the altitude closest to 300 km. when there are 3 receivers.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Saskatoon MF radar is located in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada (52N, 107W). The solar local time (SLT) is Universal Time (UT) minus 7 hours and 10 minutes. (SLT = UT - 7:10). The phases are in SLT and the measurement days start at 0 UT. The Saskatoon MF radar has provided considerable mean winds (Manson et al., 1990a and 1991a) and tidal data (Manson et al, 1989) since 1979. LTCS-1 and LTCS-2 are described for all middle atmosphere radars in Manson et al (1990b,1991b). MF radars use the "spaced antenna" method. Harmonic analysis is applied to hourly mean winds (weighted by data yield per hour) at individual heights to obtain tides for the prime LTCS or stated intervals. Typical standard deviations for means, 12-hour and 24-hour tides are in the above LTCS papers. Tides of the month for Saskatoon are means of 4-day fits (the amplitudes are arithmetic means). Data up to 99 km are real heights --- above, they are from the E-region, a layer about 5 km centered near 102 km.

These are the analyzed data on the neutral winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere during or including the LTCS-1 period, 21-25 September 1987. This condensed format is consistent with the analyzed data from other sites as well, and is prepared in order to facilitate research work. However, users need to inform the data suppliers that they are using the data in case of updates or changes, and to insure that the data are being used and interpreted properly.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Poker Flat MST radar was located at the Poker Flat Rocket range about 200 m above mean sea level in Alaska at (65.13N, 145.46W), and operated between 1979 and 1987. The last 2 years are not in the CEDAR Data Base. The inclination angle is about 77 degrees, and the declination is about 29 degrees to the east of north.

The Poker Flat radar was a high power radar, with three narrow beams. One beam looked vertically (kindat=20003) and the other two were inclined at 15 degrees to vertical, or at an elevation angle of 75 degrees. The 'east' beam had an azimuth 26 degrees north of east (kindat=20001) while the 'north' beam had an azimuth 26 degrees west of north (kindat=20002). Most of the data were taken using all three beams but some, especially in the early days, were taken with only the vertical beam or with only the oblique beams. During an experiment one or more beams were sometimes inactivated. The cycle time for a complete set of vertical and oblique records seldom exceeded 10 min and was typically 1 min. When available, velocity measurements from the two oblique beams were combined to give eastward and northward components of the neutral wind (kindat=20004). The velocity spread is twice the square root of the second moment of the power spectrum and is a measure of shear or turbulence in the measurement volume.

Data quality below 5 km is definitely dubious and below 8 km should be treated with suspicion due to recovery problems. The more obviously false data have been removed from this data set but consistently false data are hard to distinguish from the real thing and may be included.

The original Poker Flat data set has been subjected to an extensive set of checks to remove various interference modes, outliers and otherwise non-atmoshperic data. The parameters for the remaining data have been averaged for all appropriate records that commenced within a one hour interval. Note that these are averages of the derived parameters and not parameters derived from an average velocity spectrum.

In the absence of any signal echo the main contribution to noise is the radio noise from our galaxy. Hence there is a siderial variation (of about 4 db) in the noise level. Atmospheric absorption events reduce the level of noise. Receiver gain and cable attenuation fluctuations may have a small influence. Operator modification of gain controls are rare. Strong signals can corrupt the computation through their sidelobes. The errors given are the root mean square values of the deviation from the mean for that hour. </rdfs:comment>

            >The NCAR TIGCM models output neutral winds and temperature. Specific TIGCM results are shown for the storm of March 22, 1979. The other results are of generic runs with the TIGCM which are described in Fesen (1997, JASTP, 785).

The TIGCM model solves and saves 16 parameters: ht, Tn, un, vn, wn, N2, O2, O, N(4S), N(2D), NO, Te, Ti, Ne, O+, and O2+. The O+-O collision frequency was increased by a factor of 1.7 in the model over the laboratory value, as recommended by Burnside et al (1988, JGR, 8642) and Salah (1993, GRL, 1543).

The model has 36 latitudes between -87.5 and +87.5 degrees geographic every 5 degrees apart, 72 longitudes between -180 and +175 geographic every 5 degrees apart, and 25 pressure levels between 97.5 km and approximately 500 km.

This data set has interpolated (or extrapolated) values of the neutral zonal and meridional wind and neutral temperature at 22 heights between 100 and 500 km for all 36 latitudes at 24 longitudes every 15 degrees apart between -165 and +180 degrees. The diurnally reproducible results were saved for 25 UTs, and then harmonic analyses of these parameters were computed.

Eighteen generic runs were made in 1993 for solar minimum (1976, with an assumed solar flux (350) of 75) and solar maximum (1979 with an assumed solar flux of 195), for three seasons (days 80, 172, and 355), and for three levels of activity (5 GW + 30 kV, 11 GW + 60 kV, and 33 GW + 90 kV). The activity is based on the hemispheric power and the polar cap potential drop. The IMF By was assumed to be 0 nT in the parameterizations. The 1989 Forbes and Vial semidiurnal tides appropriate for March, June and December were put at the lower boundary (97 km). Another version of these runs was for 70W only.

The summary plots show the wind fields on the temperature over the globe at 300 and 140 km every 4 UT hours on March 22, 1979, and at 0 and 12 UT for the generic runs. Only the 60 kV case was plotted for the generic runs in solar minimum (sflux=75) and solar maximum (sflux=195) for March, June and December.

The tidal fields for the neutral temperature and neutral zonal and meridional wind are shown at 140 and 300 km for the generic runs as a function of longitude and latitude. The 4 plots show the mean and the 24, 12 and 8-hr tidal amplitudes. Only the 60 kV case was plotted for the generic runs in solar minimum (sflux=75) and solar maximum (sflux=195) for March, June and December. The Fesen (JASTP, 1997) reference shows the tidal variations also as a function of height and magnetic activity for 70W. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Wakkanai, Japan (45.36N, 141.81E; alt ~10 m) 1.9585 MHz MF radar has been in operation since 1996. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (38.9,-146.6) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 59.8 deg and -9.6 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 0909 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT plus 9 hours and 27 minutes (141.81/15.=9.454).

The original data files are 30 min averages of the zonal, meridional and 'vertical' velocity in UT. The UT time is the midpoint UT, and is also listed as the midpoint SLT. Samples are taken every 3, 4 or 5 min, so 6 to 10 samples can be had between UT 23:45:00 and UT 00:15:00. To improve data quality, 'median screening' is applied inside a 1-h bin. If data points lie outside a threshold standard deviation (code 4152) of usually 1.5 inside a 1-hr bin, they are discarded. So the low qulity (jamped) data are rejected and then the remaining data are averaged over 30-min bins with a threshold of usually 30% (code 4151). The number of points used in each direction are in codes 422, 423 and 424.

The 'vertical' velocities (code 1432, 'contaminated neutral vertical geographic wind (+up)') are from the beam in the vertical direction. The antenna array in a triangle has a different beam width for different azimuth direction, resulting in beam widths about 20-30 deg wide. Hence, the 'vertical' velocity will be contaminated by horizontal wind times the sine of 10 to 15 degrees (.17 to .26). Since the horizontal winds are stronger than the vertical winds, even the sign could be incorrect. The standard deviations of the 'vertical' winds are also larger than the average values.

The MF operating frequency is 1.95550 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 50 kW. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 millisec during the day and 25 millisec during the night. There are 80 coherent integrations during the day and 40 at night, using 240 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, if want 240 sec or 4 min integration during day and night, then 12.5x10-3sec * 80 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec and 25x10-3sec * 40 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec.]

Data sampling is done every 2 km usually between 60-98 km for Yamagawa (60-108 km for Wakkanai, 44-108 km for Poker Flat). The height range of wind velocity data is variable accoding to atmospheric and radio conditions and is usually about 70-90 km at Yamagawa and Wakkanai during the day and 80-90 km at night (60-90 km/70-90 km for Poker Flat for day/night conditions).

The pulse width is 48 microsec (27 microsec before September 1996), giving a height resolution of approx. 7.2 km (4.1 km) assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse. For the 48-microsec case, the range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 48x10-6s / 2 = 7.2 km. However, neutral velocities are given every 2 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Saskatoon HF radar is located in central Saskatchewan (52.16 deg N, -106.53 deg E) and looks over a section of ionosphere poleward of 53 deg N that covers north-central Canada including Hudson Bay and the Canadian arctic archipelago. It has operated since 1993. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from western North America to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of Saskatoon velocity data is located at Kapuskasing, Canada.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. A second 4-element array provide the capability to measure elevation angle. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15), ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz), iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70), and iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is typically 6 or 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is 96 sec or 120 sec. Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 23.1 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Fabry-Perot Interferometric Spectrometer at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (90.00S) has been operated since 1989 by the Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Washington, in cooperation with the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska. The instrument is located within 150 feet of the South Pole at 2835 m above mean sea level. The geographic longitude is used to reckon the azimuthal direction of observation, with 0 E corresponding to 0 deg azimuth. The apex magnetic coordinates of South Pole at 250 km height in 1992 were (-74.4, 17.7), with a magnetic declination of -21.37 deg (or 158.63 E toward the compass south pole), an inclination of -74.78 deg, and 0 UT at 2039 MLT. The invariant (apex) South Pole at 250 km height was at (74.2S, 126.0E), and the perpendicular to the magnetic latitude circle pointed to 125.6E. Hernandez et al (1991) used magnetic south towards 120 E, with 0 UT at 2023 MLT. The magnetic grid is useful for ordering the red line observations at about 250 km height, but not for other observations from emissions below 100 km height.</rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at Chatanika, Alaska (65.1N, 147.4W) operated between 1971 and 1982. It was moved to Sondrestrom in 1982-1983, where it has been in operation since 1983. There are generally 7 record types (KINDAT) for each Chatanika experiment that are usually inputs or outputs to a program called VAST, which calculates electric fields, vector velocities and conductivities. VAST assumes the velocity field varies linearly with time. Data from five positions are used to find the three line-of-sight velocities at the time of the middle observation. Full error propagation, including covariance terms, is included. The density and temperature data are combined to obtain a spatial average for the time of the middle observation.

In addition, several criterea involving the least squares fit, as well as relative absolute uncertainties, have been examined to determine whether the derived F-region vector velocities are converted to electric fields, and the good values are height integrated to find the best possible estimate of the electric field. Starting in the D-region, the averaged electron densities are used to calculate the conductivities. The calculation has been improved to explicitly include the ion-neutral collision frequencies and to include a model atmosphere. </rdfs:comment>

            <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
            >The Pykkvibaer HF radar is located in western Iceland (63.77 deg N, -20.54 deg E) and looks to the east over a section of ionosphere that includes the Greenland sea and Svaalbard. It has operated since 1995. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from western North America to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of Pykkvibaer velocity data is located at Hankasalmi, Finland.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. A second 4-element array provides the capability to measure elevation angle. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15), ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz), iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70), and iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is typically 6 or 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is 96 sec or 120 sec. Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is eastward approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 30 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATter) Svalbard Radar (ESR) consists of a transmitter and receiver in Longyearbyen, Norway (78.15N, 16.04E; 75.0 magnetic N). Observations were begun in 1996. The system was added to the EISCAT KST (Kiruna/Sodankyla/Tromso) tri-static facility in Scandinavia, which has its own web page.

There are several common programs used for the World Days, which are a part of the CEDAR Database from the KST site, but not yet on a regular basis from the ESR site. There are many other experimental times which should be accessed with the aid of an EISCAT colleague.

The power profiles are calibrated with an on-site ionosonde, and are then corrected for Te and Ti effects which are deduced from the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). The collision frequency model used is the CIRA 1972 model atmosphere in Banks and Kockarts (1973), in Aeronmy Part A. The NO+ composition is assumed zero above 300 km. </rdfs:comment>

            >These are model lunar semidiurnal tides calculated in the Earth's atmosphere. The lunar day is 24 hr 50.47 min. The phases vary between 0.00 and 12.00 hours in lunar time, where 0 lunar time refers to the time of lower transit. This is when the moon is 180 degrees opposite one's position on Earth, and is entirely analogous to solar local time. The calculations were done for each month, where the day assumed was the 15th of each month. The results are independent of solar cycle, so the year is arbitrary. The year 1993 was chosen because this was the year that the model runs were made. The semidiurnal amplitudes and phases of the eastward neutral wind, the northward neutral wind, the neutral temperature, and the geopotential are given for 12 altitudes between about 78 and 102 km. The altitudes are slightly for each month. The original results were southward winds, so the phases were shifted by 6 hours to make them northward. The maximum amplitudes are just below 20 m/s for the winds, about 6 degrees K for the temperature, and nearly 2500 m2/s2 in geopotential. Some temperature amplitudes are shown as 0 near the pole but with some phase. This is the result of truncating amplitudes less than 0.005 K.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) simulates solar diurnal and semidiurnal tides calculated in the Earth's atmosphere using realistic ozone and water vapor forcing. The calculations were done for 4 months (January, April, July, October), where the day assumed was the 15th of each month. The background winds are calculated assuming geostrophic balance between 20-80 km. Above 80 km, they are taken from the Portnyagin and Solov'eva model, and below 20 they are taken from the Groves/MSIS model. The background temperature and density are taken from the MSISE90 model using a solar flux of 120 and an Ap of 4.

The results are only weakly dependent on solar cycle, so the year is arbitrary. The year 1995 was chosen because this was the year that the reference appeared. The diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes and phases of the neutral temperature, the eastward neutral wind, the northward neutral wind, and the vertical neutral wind are given for 31 altitudes between 0 and 124 km in steps of approximately 4 km. There are 59 geographic latitudes that vary between 87 and -87 in steps of 3 degrees. The tidal results are zonal averages. The results from this set of calculations are now known as GSWM-95 tidal predictions.

The vertical velocity is defined to be 0 at the surface, but other temperature and wind values may be zero with a non-zero phase due to round-off. </rdfs:comment>

            >The incoherent scatter transmitter station at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts (42.6N, 71.5W) has been in operation since 1960. The facility is part of and operated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

ISR data comes from the fixed zenith antenna, the steerable antenna, or both.

The electron densities from the power profile were calibrated with an on-site ionosonde, where recently, this ionosonde has been the University of Massachusetts at Lowell digisonde. Since the Coast Guard uses some of the frequencies needed to properly scan the ionosphere, calibration can sometimes be difficult. The calibrated electron density is then corrected for Te and Ti effects, where Te and Ti come from auto-correlation fits. The calibration and auto-correlation fits now have the same height resolution, although in the past, the auto-correlation fits had lower height resolution.

The ion composition changes from mostly O2+ and NO+ at lower altitudes, to mostly O+, and then to H+ and some He+ at higher altitudes. Above 400 km, the percent H+ is computed along with the major ion O+. At lower altitudes, the ratio of molecular ions to the total number of ions is modeled as specified by the FORTRAN code segment below.

            >The Wuppertal, Germany (51.3N, 7.2E) Czerny-Turner grating spectrometer scans in the near infrared between 1.05 - 1.74 um with a spectral resolution of about 450. It has been operated by the University of Wuppertal since 1980. The instrument measures the nightglow hydroxyl [OH*]. The [OH*] emission layer is centered near 87 km (+/-2 km) with a thickness of about 9 km.

Measured parameters are the hydroxyl Meinel band rotational temperature (Code 812) in tenths of Kelvin. To reduce NLTE effects as much as possible, the (3,1) transition lines P1(2), P1(3) and P1(4) near 1.5 um are chosen for the measurements. More than 3100 average nightly mean temperatures are available continously from July 1980 until now with a gap in 1985/86. The instrument field-of-view in the zenith has a horizontal resolution of 20x20 km^2 (with respect to 86 km altitude). One spectrum is measured in 90 s.

Rotational temperatures are derived from the relative intensities of the three lines. Hence, if there should be changes of spectrometer sensitivity, atmospheric transmission, or other factors the derived temperatures would not be affected unless such changes are wavelength dependent. Even in that case, influences would be small because the three line are close together (1.524 um, 1.533 um, 1.543 um).

The relative error of nightly mean temperature values is estimated to be 1-2 K. This is derived from measurements during the whole night, and therefore, it still contains some atmospheric variability. Thus, the value must be considered as an upper limit for the relative error. The absolute temperature error is of the same magnitude. Spectral and absolute intensity calibrations are performed about once per year.</rdfs:comment>

It has operated since 1983. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from western North America to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere.

These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. Typical beam integration times are 5 and 6 sec, corresponding to scan repeat times of 80 and 96 sec, respectively. Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is eastward approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 5 deg E of N. </rdfs:comment>

            >The EISCAT (European Incoherent SCATter) facility in Scandinavia consists of a transimitter/receiver station at Tromso, Norway (69.6N, 19.2E), and receiver stations at Kiruna, Sweden (67.9N, 20.4E) and Sodankyla, Finland (67.4N, 26.6E). The facility has been in operation since 1981.

The power profiles are calibrated with an on-site ionosonde, and are then corrected for Te and Ti effects which are deduced from the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). The collision frequency model used is the CIRA 1972 model atmosphere in Banks and Kockarts (1973), in Aeronmy Part A. The NO+ composition is assumed zero above 300 km. Perpendicular and parallel ion velocities were calculated routinely beginning in March, 1990.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Syowa East HF radar is located in Antarctica (69.00 deg S, 39.58 deg E) and looks over a section of ionosphere poleward of 70 deg S that includes the east Antarctica ice cap and the southern ocean. It has operated since 1997. The facility is part of the SuperDARN network of HF radars that extends from Alaska to Scandinavia in the Northern hemisphere and covers much of Antarctica in the Southern hemisphere. The SuperDARN radar for the most direct 2-D merging of Syowa velocity data is located at Kerguelen.

The radar forms and steers its beam by the phasing of transmissions from 16 elements in a linear antenna array. A second 4-element array provide the capability to measure elevation angle. The basic radar operation consists of the following steps: i) selection of a beam position (0-15) ii) search for the quietest 5-kHz channel about the assigned transmitting frequency (8-20 MHz) iii) repeated transmission of a multi-pulse sequence over the selected integration period and reception of backscattered signal with gating in range (1-70) iv) calculation of the auto-correlation functions (ACFs). These operations are usually carried out in sequence for the 16 beam positions, which collectively constitute 1 scan. The beam integration period is usually 7 sec, and the scan repeat time is then 120 sec (2 min). Within a scan, beam 0 corresponds to the most westward beam position and beam 15 to the most eastward. The azimuth sector scanned is approximately 50 deg wide and is centered on 107.0 deg E of N, or about 52 degrees east of the look direction for Syowa South. </rdfs:comment>

            >The Yamagawa, Japan (31.20N, 130.62E; alt ~70 m) 1.9550 MHz MF radar has been in operation since 1994. On day 359 of 2001 at 89 km altitude, the apex magnetic coordinates were (25.1,-157.3) degrees. The magnetic inclination and declination angles were 44.7 deg and -5.6 deg. The magnetic local time at 0 Universal Time (UT) is about 0826 MLT. The solar local time (SLT) is UT plus 8 hours and 42 minutes (130.62/15.=8.708).

The original data files are 30 min averages of the zonal, meridional and 'vertical' velocity in UT. The UT time is the midpoint UT, and is also listed as the midpoint SLT. Samples are taken every 3, 4 or 5 min, so 6 to 10 samples can be had between UT 23:45:00 and UT 00:15:00. To improve data quality, 'median screening' is applied inside a 1-h bin. If data points lie outside a threshold standard deviation (code 4152) of usually 1.5 inside a 1-hr bin, they are discarded. So the low qulity (jamped) data are rejected and then the remaining data are averaged over 30-min bins with a threshold of usually 30% (code 4151). The number of points used in each direction are in codes 422, 423 and 424.

The 'vertical' velocities (code 1432, 'contaminated neutral vertical geographic wind (+up)') are from the beam in the vertical direction. The antenna array in a triangle has a different beam width for different azimuth direction, resulting in beam widths about 20-30 deg wide. Hence, the 'vertical' velocity will be contaminated by horizontal wind times the sine of 10 to 15 degrees (.17 to .26). Since the horizontal winds are stronger than the vertical winds, even the sign could be incorrect. The standard deviations of the 'vertical' winds are also larger than the average values.

The MF operating frequency is 1.95550 MHz, with a peak transmitter power of 50 kW. The radar operates as a spaced-antenna system (Vincent, 1986), relying on coherent echo signals from middle atmosphere ionization. The inter-pulse period is 12.5 millisec during the day and 25 millisec during the night. There are 80 coherent integrations during the day and 40 at night, using 240 samples in the full correlation analysis (FCA) of Briggs [1984] with built-in rejection criteria. [ie, if want 240 sec or 4 min integration during day and night, then 12.5x10-3sec * 80 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec and 25x10-3sec * 40 integ * 240 samples = 240 sec.]

Data sampling is done every 2 km usually between 60-98 km for Yamagawa (60-108 km for Wakkanai, 44-108 km for Poker Flat). The height range of wind velocity data is variable accoding to atmospheric and radio conditions and is usually about 70-90 km at Yamagawa and Wakkanai during the day and 80-90 km at night (60-90 km/70-90 km for Poker Flat for day/night conditions).

The pulse width is 48 microsec (27 microsec before September 1996), giving a height resolution of approx. 7.2 km (4.1 km) assuming a simple rectangular wave pulse. For the 48-microsec case, the range of heights illuminated by the wave pulse = velocity of light * pulse-width / 2 = 3x10**8 m/s * 48x10-6s / 2 = 7.2 km. However, neutral velocities are given every 2 km. </rdfs:comment>

The geographic coordinates are 75.5 deg S, 26.6 deg W, and the invariant geomagnetic coordinates are 61.5 deg S, 28.9 deg E. The magnetic inclination is 64 deg and magnetic north is 2 deg west of geographic north. The mean local time is 1 hour and 46 minutes (-26.6/15.) before Universal Time.

            >The Watson Lake Fabry-Perot interferometer, operated by the Space Physics Research Laboratory, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences of the University of Michigan is located at latitude 60.055N and longitude 128.58W, and at an altitude of 2950 feet. The FPI operated from 11/91-4/92 and 11/92-5/93.

Currently, the interferometer observes the line profile of the forbidden emission OI (6300 A). The geophysical parameters obtained from the data reduction are the gas kinetic temperature of the emitting region from the natural width of the sky profile, the line of sight wind from the Doppler shift of the sky profile, and the surface brightness of the emission line. OI (6300 A) nightglow emission is generally believed to issue from the altitude range 175 to 500 km, with the major contribution originating from a narrow height interval (a few scale heights thick) centered roughly one neutral scale height below the altitude of maximum electron density. Thus, the peak altitude of emission and the parameters of the F region are interdependent and it is difficult to assign a unique altitude to each ground based OI (6300 A) interferometer measurement. If no other information is available, we generally ascribe 250 km as the altitude of emission.

Line of sight winds derived from the observed shift of the emission line from a zero reference position requires the determination of a zero wind. The reference zero wind is taken to be the average of an entire nights vertical wind data. Generally, the four cardinal directions are also sampled as well as the vertical. There is no exclusion of any data in the CEDAR Data Base, so cloudy night fits are also included. The cloud cover (code 440) measured by the Watson Lake meteorological station is given in octas of the sky covered. Values range from 0 (clear) to 9 (overcast).

Summary plots of the relative emission, neutral temeprature and vertical wind are plotted with error bars for the vertical look direction. For look directions in opposite cardinal directions, horizontal winds are plotted without error bars. For periods where there are plots of the vertical wind, but not of the horizontal wind, then the look directions are not cardinal. In the summary plots, wind measurements were not plotted unless the cloud cover was 0-3. Temperatures and relative emission measurements were not plotted unless the cloud cover was 0-6. For the period of data in the CEDAR Data Base, the cloud cover was 0-3 38% of the time, and 0-6 48% of the time.</rdfs:comment>

            >The Aerospace 4 channel filter photometer at Poker Flat, Alaska (65.12N, 212.57E) was developed to estimate the energy flux of auroral electrons, their average energy Eo (usually from 0.1 to 30 keV using a modified Gaussian or Maxwellian shape), and a scale factor fo for the atomic oxygen densities [O] from an MSIS model atmosphere. The [O] densities using the scaling factor fo can be compared to GUVI/TIMED estimates. The technique is only valid for clear night conditions where the solar zenith angle (sza) is greater than 102 deg (code 4102=1), and there is enough auroral emission (427.8 nm brightness, code 2421). Poker Flat apex magnetic coordinates are (65.44, -95.56) at 110 km in 2001, with 0 UT corresponding to 12.93 MLT. The magnetic inclination and declination angles are 77.41 deg and 24.89 deg. The photometer looks up the magnetic field line with a field of view (fov) of about 1 deg. The data rate can be programmed, but typically each channel is integrated for 1 sec, where the whole cycle including filter moves takes about 8 sec.

The 4 channels correspond to:

   1. N2+ (427.8 nm, blue) first negative group (1NG) 0,1 molecular band
   2. OI (630.0 nm, red) forbidden
   3. OI (844.6 nm, eight) permitted
   4. N2 (871.0 nm or 871.4 nm) first positive group (1PG) 2,1 molecular band </rdfs:comment>

            >Between August 1974 and April 1987, the Georgia Tech Radio Meteor Wind Facility was in routine operation, measuring winds between 80 and 100 km over Atlanta, Georgia, USA. A series of technical reports has been published on the measurements (Roper, 1978; 1982; 1984; 1987).

At meteor heights, the viewing area was a slab 400 km in diameter across. Significant results were achieved by averaging from 5 days to 2 weeks of data. The local mean solar time for Atlanta is the Universal Time minus 5 hours and 37 minutes. The tabulations are the result of matching the data against the model developed by Groves (1959). The model assumes cubic variations with height H for prevailing, diurnal and semidiurnal components of the horizontal wind. </rdfs:comment>

    >The Arecibo Observatory is located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on the north coast of the island. It is operated by Cornell University under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. The observatory works as the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) although both names are officially used to refer to it.
The observatory's radio telescope is the largest single-aperture telescope ever to be constructed. (Compare "multiple aperture telescope".) It collects radio astronomy, terrestrial aeronomy, and planetary radar data for scientists around the world. Usage of the telescope is gained by submitting proposals to an independent board of referees.
Although it has been given many usages, the observatory's main purpose is to detail and observe stellar objects.</rdfs:comment>
